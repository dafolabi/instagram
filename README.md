# Project 3 - *Name of App Here*

**Name of your app** is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [X] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [X] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [X] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [X] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- [X] User can pull to refresh the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"
- [X] User can tap a post to view post details, including timestamp and caption.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Style the login page to look like the real Instagram login page. - (custom styled bee theme)
- [X] Style the feed to look like the real Instagram feed. - (custom styled bee theme)
- [X] User can use a tab bar to switch between all "Instagram" posts and posts published only by the user. AKA, tabs - [ ] for Home Feed and Profile
- [X] Add a custom camera using the CameraManager library.
- [X] User can load more posts once he or she reaches the bottom of the feed using infinite scrolling.
- [X] Show the username and creation time for each post
Hint: If you use TableView Section Headers to display the the username and creation time, you'll get "sticky headers" - [ ] similar to the actual Instagram app.
- [X] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse
- User Profiles:
   - [ ] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
   - [ ] Display the profile photo with each post
   - [ ] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page
- [X] User can comment on a post and see all comments for each post in the post details screen.
- [X] User can like a post and see number of likes for each post in the post details screen.
- [X] Run your app on your phone and use the camera to take the photo
The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. There were so many features that were avaiable to do, next time I would like to go more in depth in one particular feature and make it super polished as opposed to have multiple features that are not as developped. Overall, the instagram app was a fun experience and since it relied on so many topics that we have learned so far, it helped to cement my knowledge of swift and I felt that I grew the most as a programmer during this internship on this assignment
2. A cool thing to extend the app would be to allow the user to share a picture direction from the camera roll to instagram without having to open the instagram app. Currently, the actually instagram app is not capable of doing this, so it would be a neat feature to have in our "clone" instagram app.
